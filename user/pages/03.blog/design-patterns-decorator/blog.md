**S.O.L.I.D** is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.
SOLID represents a series of guidelines that developers can use to, if done well, simplify and clarify their code. 
These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to 
maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, 
easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
Understanding these concepts will make you a better developer.
