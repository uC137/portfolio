**S.O.L.I.D** is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

Note: this is just a simple “welcome to S.O.L.I.D” article, it simply sheds light on what S.O.L.I.D is.

**S.O.L.I.D** STANDS FOR:

When expanded the acronyms might seem complicated, but they are pretty simple to grasp.

* **S** – Single-responsiblity principle
* **O** – Open-closed principle
* **L** – Liskov substitution principle
* **I** – Interface segregation principle
* **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle

Let’s look at each principle individually to understand why S.O.L.I.D can help make us better developers.
